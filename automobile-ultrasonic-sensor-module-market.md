<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automobile Ultrasonic Sensor Module Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Reflective Type</li><li>Transmission Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automobile ultrasonic sensor module market can be classified into two main types: reflective type and transmission type. Reflective type sensors emit ultrasonic waves and measure the time it takes for the waves to bounce back from nearby objects, making them ideal for applications like parking assistance. In contrast, transmission type sensors involve two separate units: one transmitter and one receiver. They detect objects by measuring the interruption of ultrasonic waves between them, commonly used for collision avoidance systems in vehicles.</p></p>
