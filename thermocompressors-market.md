<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thermocompressors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Nozzle Thermocompressors</li><li>Multi Nozzle Thermocompressors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The thermocompressors market is primarily divided into two types: single nozzle and multi nozzle thermocompressors. Single nozzle thermocompressors utilize a single jet of high-pressure steam to mix with low-pressure steam, effectively increasing output pressure and optimizing energy efficiency for smaller applications. In contrast, multi nozzle thermocompressors feature multiple nozzles, allowing for greater capacity and flexibility in managing larger steam flows. These systems are widely used in industries like food processing, chemical manufacturing, and energy production for efficient thermal energy recovery.</p></p>
