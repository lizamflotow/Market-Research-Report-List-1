<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The HER2 Inhibitors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>"Monotherapy"</li><li>"Combination Therapy"</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The HER2 inhibitors market is segmented into two primary types: monotherapy and combination therapy. Monotherapy involves the use of a single HER2-targeted drug to treat cancers like breast cancer, providing a focused approach for patients with HER2-positive tumors. In contrast, combination therapy employs HER2 inhibitors alongside other treatment modalities, such as chemotherapy or immunotherapy, to enhance efficacy and address potential resistance. This dual strategy often results in improved patient outcomes and broader treatment options within the oncology landscape.</p></p>
