<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Commercial Heating Boilers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-condensing Boilers</li><li>Condensing Boilers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The commercial heating boilers market encompasses two primary types: non-condensing and condensing boilers. Non-condensing boilers operate at higher temperatures, primarily using gas or oil for combustion, and are typically less efficient, leading to higher energy costs. In contrast, condensing boilers utilize heat from exhaust gases to improve efficiency, achieving energy savings by condensing water vapor into liquid. This efficiency makes condensing boilers increasingly popular in commercial settings, where optimizing energy consumption and reducing operational costs are essential.</p></p>
